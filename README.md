## Table of Contents
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [Tests](#tests)
- [Questions](#questions)

## Installation
To install the application locally, ensure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed, then clone the repository from Github and run the installation script ```npm run install``` followed by the start script ```node index.js```. 

## Usage
After the tool is installed and started, you will be prompted with a series of questions regarding your README. Respond to the questions accordingly, and if there are sections without content, respond 'N/A.' After responding to all prompts, a markdown file will be created and named with the title of your application. After you have moved the file to the appropriate folder or workspace, be sure to rename the file 'README.md' to follow proper naming syntax. The generated README will include Title, License Badge, Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, Credits, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions sections.
