## Installation
To install this command-line tool, first pull the code. Then, in your command-line, install the npm dependency, inquirer, by running npm i. After that, run node index.js in the command-line to run the program.

## Usage
After the tool is installed and run, you will be prompted with a series of questions regarding your README. Respond to the questions accordingly, and if there are sections without content, respond 'N/A.' After responding to all prompts, a markdown file will be created and named with the title of your application. After you have moved the file to the appropriate folder or workspace, be sure to rename the file 'README.md' to follow proper naming syntax.
